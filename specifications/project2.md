Project 2 - TF-IDF Scoring and Search
==========================

*tentative and subject to change*

For this project, you will modify your InvertedIndex to include a`search` method that will take as input a (possibly multi-word) query and will return a list of documents matching the query. The list will be sorted according to the [Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency](http://www.tfidf.com/) score calculated by your program.
